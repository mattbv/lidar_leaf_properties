    """
    Function to create a set of nearest neighbors indices and their respective
    distances for a set of points. This function uses a knn search and sets a
    limit size for a block of points to query. This makes it less efficient in
    terms of processing time, but avoids running out of memory in cases of
    very dense/large arrays/queries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array
        N-dimensional array to perform the knn search on.
    pts : array
        N-dimensional array to search for on the knn search.
    knn : int
        Number of nearest neighbors to search for.
    return_dist : boolean
        Option to return or not the distances of each neighbor.
    block_size : int
        Limit of points to query. The variable 'pts' will be subdivided in n
        blocks of size block_size to perform query.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : array
        Set of neighbors indices from 'arr' for each entry in 'pts'.
